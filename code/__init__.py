"""
Package implementing FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB and related functionalities.

This package provides the implementation and supporting tools for the FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB
algorithm, a novel approach for handling class imbalance in machine learning datasets.
It includes modules for generating synthetic samples, dataset preprocessing, and visualization.

Sub-Packages:
- `code.FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB`: Core implementation of the FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB algorithm.
- `code.FLY-SMOTE.old`: Legacy implementation of earlier versions of FLY-SMOTE for comparison purposes.
- `code.scripts`: Utility scripts for tasks such as data visualization, sensitivity analysis, and result aggregation.
- `code.shared`: Shared utilities and helper functions used across the package.

Key Features:
- Synthetic sample generation using FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB.
- Tools for managing class imbalance in datasets with high flexibility.
- Modular design to support preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Visualization scripts for sensitivity analysis and data exploration.

This package is designed for researchers and practitioners working on imbalanced datasets,
offering both the FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB algorithm and auxiliary tools for streamlined experimentation.
