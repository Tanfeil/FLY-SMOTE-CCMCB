"""
Package for generating and saving plots for model evaluation in the FLY-SMOTE-CCMCB project.

This package is responsible for creating visualizations based on the results obtained from various experiments. It processes the experimental data, aggregates relevant statistics, and generates plots such as accuracy over rounds, sensitivity, and other relevant performance metrics. The visualizations help in understanding and comparing the performance of models across different configurations and datasets.

Modules include:
- Plotting functions for visualizing model accuracy and sensitivity over different parameter values
- Integration with Weights & Biases (W&B) for fetching experiment results
- Saving generated plots to specified directories for later use
